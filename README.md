# lagoon

   Vagrant box for quick [Aquameta](https://github.com/aquametalabs/aquameta) install  

   Hosted on Atlas - [micburks/lagoon](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/micburks/boxes/lagoon)  

   Install with `vagrant init micburks/lagoon; vagrant up --provider virtualbox`  

## todo
1. Aquameta is currently broken
  * Install doesn't check out resources or widgets. Seems to be a problem with hash/blobs

2. Steal awesome features from laravel/homestead
  * port forwarding
  * sites
  * directory sharing
